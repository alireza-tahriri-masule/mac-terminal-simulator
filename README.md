## 📚 Usage Instructions

Once the simulation is running, follow these steps to interact with the terminal:

1. **Watch the Simulation**  
   The terminal automatically simulates commands and displays the output with a typewriter effect.

2. **Modify Commands**  
   You can customize the commands and their outputs by editing the `commands.json` file located in the `src/json` directory.  
   Example structure of the JSON file:  
   ```json
   [
       {
           "command": "ls",
           "result": "Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures  Videos"
       },
       {
           "command": "pwd",
           "result": "/Users/username"
       }
   ]
   ```

3. **Style the Terminal**  
   Modify the `src/css/app.css` file to adjust the terminal’s design, such as colors, fonts, and dimensions.

4. **Run Custom Code**  
   Update the logic in `src/js/app.js` to add more functionality or customize animations and effects.

5. **Responsive Design**  
   Test the terminal on different devices to see its adaptive behavior.
